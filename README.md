# Facial-Emotion-Recognition-using-Deep-Learning


This project focuses on enhancing **Facial Emotion Recognition (FER)** performance on the **FER-2013 dataset** using deep learning models. The goal is to classify facial expressions into seven categories: *Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Neutral*.  

While facial emotion recognition is challenging due to **low resolution, noise, and textural variations**, this project integrates deep learning with preprocessing techniques to improve accuracy and builds a **real-time emotion detection system**.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Highlights
- Implemented **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** from scratch and fine-tuned pretrained models - ResNet50 for FER classification.  
- Explored **image preprocessing** and stacking filtered images with originals to enrich model input.  
- Achieved performance improvements by leveraging **deep learning-based feature extraction** over raw FER-2013 images.  
- Built a **real-time facial emotion detection system** using **OpenCV**, where webcam input is passed through trained CNN models for live prediction.
